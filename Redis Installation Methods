This document provides step-by-step instructions to install Redis on an Ubuntu system. It covers installation from the official Ubuntu repository as well as building Redis from source.

Prerequisites
A fresh Ubuntu system or a system with root (sudo) privileges.
An internet connection to download required packages and Redis.
Method 1: Install Redis from Ubuntu's Official Repository
Step 1: Update Package List
First, update the local package index to ensure you have the latest repository information.

Command :

sudo apt update
Step 2: Install Redis
Use the apt package manager to install Redis.

Command :

sudo apt install redis-server
Step 3: Start and Enable Redis Service
Once installed, Redis should start automatically. To ensure Redis starts on boot, use the following commands:

Command :

sudo systemctl start redis
sudo systemctl enable redis
Step 4: Verify Redis is Running
Check that Redis is running by checking its status.

Command :

sudo systemctl status redis
You should see an output similar to the following if Redis is running:

arduino

active (running)
Step 5: Test Redis Installation
Use the Redis CLI to verify Redis is working.

Command :

redis-cli
Then, test Redis by running:

Command :

ping
Redis should respond with:

nginx

PONG
Method 2: Install Redis from Source (for Custom Version)
If you want to install the latest version of Redis or need custom configurations, you can install Redis from the source.

Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary build tools and libraries.

Command :

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential tcl
Step 2: Download Redis
Download the latest stable version of Redis. You can always visit the Redis download page for the latest release.

Command :

wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
Step 3: Extract the Tarball
Once the download is complete, extract the .tar.gz file.

Command :

tar xzvf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
Step 4: Build Redis
Compile Redis using the make command.

Command :

make
Step 5: (Optional) Run Redis Tests
To ensure that Redis is compiled correctly, you can run the test suite.

Command :

make test
Step 6: Install Redis
After the build process completes, install Redis on your system.

Command :

sudo make install
Step 7: Run Redis
To run Redis manually, you can start it using:

Command :

redis-server
Step 8: Run Redis in the Background
To run Redis as a background service, you can specify a configuration file and start Redis in daemon mode.

Command :

redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf
Additional Configuration (Optional)
Enable Redis to Start on Boot
If you installed Redis from the source and want it to start automatically upon boot, you can configure Redis as a service using systemd.

Create a Redis service file: Create a file in /etc/systemd/system/redis.service with the following content:

ini

[Unit]
Description=Redis In-Memory Data Store
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf
ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/redis-cli shutdown
Restart=always
User=redis
Group=redis

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Reload systemd and enable Redis:

Command :

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable redis
Start the Redis service:

Command :

sudo systemctl start redis
Troubleshooting
1. Error: Refusing to operate on alias name or linked unit file
If you see this error while enabling Redis, it means Redis is already enabled as a service or linked in a non-standard way. This is typically not a problem as Redis should be running.

You can verify if Redis is running with:

Command :

sudo systemctl status redis
If Redis is running as expected, you do not need to enable it again.

2. Redis Doesn't Start Automatically
If Redis doesn't start automatically on boot, you can try enabling the service again:

Command :

sudo systemctl enable redis
3. Verifying Redis Is Running
You can check the Redis status with:

Command :

sudo systemctl status redis
Alternatively, you can test Redis by connecting to it via the CLI:

Command :

redis-cli
ping
If Redis is working correctly, you should get a response:

nginx

PONG
Conclusion
You have successfully installed Redis on Ubuntu using either the official repository or from source. Redis should now be running and accessible at 127.0.0.1:6379. You can use it for caching, data storage, or other real-time applications.

Make sure to review the Redis documentation for further configuration options and optimizations.
